# WannaCry-Worm

What is it ?

Wannacrypt0r is a new strain of ransomware.

Unlike its predecessors, it does not require logged in credentials or email dissemination. As soon as a computer is powered on the LAN and/or the Internet, it can be infected. No user interaction is required.
Why is it so dangerous ?

Because it does not require user interaction to propagate, it was capable of infecting more than 100000 computers in 24 hours. Some high-end victims include the british National Health Service (NHS) and its hospitals, spanish telecom operator Telefonica, french car manufacturer Renault and german railway operator Deutsche Bahn (DB).
